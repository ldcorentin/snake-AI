# snake-AI
This is an attempt to make a neural network based on a genetic algorithm

## Getting Started
To run this program, you just have to activate javascript in your browser (if it's desactivate) and then open index.html

## Acknowledgments

This code is mainly based on two articles :
* the [article](https://becominghuman.ai/designing-ai-solving-snake-with-evolution-f3dd6a9da867) of Peter Binggeser
* and this [article](https://wagenaartje.github.io/neataptic/articles/agario)

## Stack
* [Neataptic](https://wagenaartje.github.io/neataptic) - Genetic Algorithm and Neural Network
* [p5.js](https://p5js.org/): Graphics and animation. p5.js has the same purpose as processing
* [Frappe Charts](https://frappe.io): Chart showing the score history. It's well documented and easy to use
